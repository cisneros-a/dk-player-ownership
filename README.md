# dk-player-ownership

## This is a project to better analyze Draftkings lineups and outcomes. It takes a csv file from a DraftKings contest and parses it to get to hopefully get data that we can use to determine successfull strategies.

### Two methods so far.

### 1. First method determines player ownership %'s for a whole contest. You can also do this per user with an optional argument.

### 2. Second method takes in a username and determines their total payout for the particular contest.

#### Note: Right now, we have to manually enter contest payout structure. Would like to add a scraper to insert contest link and get us the payout structure.
